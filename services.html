              <p>
                We understand that young riders and petite equestrians may
                require a special touch when it comes to horse riding. That's
                why we've carefully curated a selection of small and gentle
                horses that are perfectly suited for kids or those of smaller
                stature. Our commitment to safety and fun remains paramount,
                ensuring that even our youngest riders have the opportunity to
                connect with these magnificent animals and experience the thrill
                of horseback riding.
